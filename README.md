# Project Name

Implementation of Reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning as an application for robotics to solve a maze based on a given input of an image of the maze.
The project is a part of the course "MFG 598: Engineering Computing w/Python" under the guidance of Dr. Binil Starley at Arizon State University.

The project is written in Python 3.11.5 and majorly uses the following libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, cv2.

## Table of Contents

envCreating.py - Creates the environment for the maze taken the input of an image of a maze.
gui.py - Creates a GUI for the maze environment.
RLsolver.py - Solves the maze using Q-learning.
mazeEnv.xlsx - Excel file containing the maze environment.
QValues.json - JSON file containing the Q-values of the maze environment. Updated after every exploration cycle.
The image of the maze used for this project is as below:
![maze](maze.jpg)
The code is built to work with any maze image. The image of the maze can be changed by changing the path of the image in the envCreating.py file.
